My name is Matthew Wile and I am an Honors Finance student at the Alberta School of Business. I have spent my academic career focused on acquiring an advanced knowledge of financial theory and markets with equal focus on collecting hard technical skills including data wrangling, visualization, and modelling. I am an excellent communicator, refuse failure in all its forms, and am committed to improving my abilities and increasing my knowledge base with the world's best.
